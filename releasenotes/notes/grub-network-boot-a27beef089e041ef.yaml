    It is now possible to do a PXE network boot with grub as an alternative to
    iPXE. Grub is loaded via the signed shim, so it may allow end-to-end
    automated deployments with secure-boot enabled.

    To use grub network boot, deploy bifrost with variable
    ``default_boot_interface`` set to ``pxe`` and use the ``pxe`` boot interface
    when deploying nodes.
